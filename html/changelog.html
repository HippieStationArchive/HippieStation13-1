				<li class="experimental">Complete changeling rework! Now changeling abilities are divided into tiers based on required amount of absorbtions to unlock them. You start with 5 Evolution Points by default and have access to Tier 1, which includes various stings. You also have lesser form and mimic voice abilities from the start.</li>
				<li class="experimental">This is a VERY experimental update, and all player feedback is much appreciated!</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New Changeling UI sprites by Fury McFlurry! Go make him a cake or something.</li>
				<li class="rscremove">Removed Changeling Shield, Chitinous Armor and Extract DNA sting</li>
				<li class="rscremove">Removed Changeling team objectives</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added synaptic enhancement as a changeling ability. When active, this will halve the delay between actions such as attacking.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Paralysis Sting has been re-added and revamped. After a short delay based on the victim's health, they will be knocked down for fifteen seconds.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Death Sting has been re-added and revamped. It will inject them with a small dosage of Wasting Toxin with slow metabolization rate, which will slowly drain blood and deal toxin damage to the victim.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Horror Form has been added. When used, this will transform the changeling into their powerful true form, able to deal powerful damage, crawl through vents, and tear into living and dead humans to heal themselves. They will be incapable of returning to a human for three minutes, and when they do, are stunned for ten seconds. Death will automatically turn them back into humans and knock them out for thirty seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chameleon ability for Changelings now makes them invisible to mouse cursor when they're completely invisible.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Chameleon ability has been sped up slightly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution points have received a large rebalance. Changelings now start with five points, and will gain two more after each absorption. Some abilities take more than five points to unlock, meaning powerful abilities like Fleshmend will be locked by default. If a changeling absorbs another changeling, the absorber will gain the other's remaining genetic points.</li>
				<li class="tweak">There is now no limit on genomes storable for transformation. This means that you will be able to transform into anyone you have absorbed past the first six.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Mute Sting now functions based on the Mute Toxin reagent and lasts for much shorter.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blind Sting now confuses the victim for a short duration.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">!!MASSIVE MARTIAL ARTS REWORK!!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">===</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Pinning people down is no longer possible unless you have an appropriate martial art.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Security Officers, including the Detective, now spawn with a Krav Maga Martial Art! Krav Maga martial art functions differently from it's /tg/ counterpart. Hippie Station's version lets you pin people down, as well as perform robust disarms that instantly put the weapon in your hands.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- You can now perform a pindown if you attack your opponent with grab item, with disarm intent, in AGGRESSIVE grab stage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ported Atlas Station wrestling with a bunch of tweaks! There are too many possible moves that you can perform to list their executions here, but, here's what you can do:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance), Backhand Chop, Chop Drop, Choke Slam, Back Breaker, Moonsault, Corkscrew Elbow Drop, Suplex, Tombstone Piledriver, Cutter/RKO and finally, the Powerbomb!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Completely rewritten the CQC martial art to be more faithful to the Metal Gear franchise, as well as making it very viable in 1v1 surprise attacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Current CQC moves:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Roundhouse Kick (5-hit combo, KO)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Face Slam (Neck Grab + Harm Intent + attack w/ grab, KO, small brute)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Robust Disarm (Same as Krav Maga - instantly puts weapon in-hand, sacrifices push down chance)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Karate Chop (Neck Grab + Disarm Intent + attack w/ grab, +20 Staminaloss, makes victim confused)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- Half-wing choke (Replaces choking, twice as fast to perform, adds +20 staminaloss on attempt)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasma Fist Martial Art was completely rewritten to make your punches MUCH faster, but some combos are harder to execute!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Current Plasma Fist moves (H = Harm, D = Disarm, G = Grab):</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- TORNADO COMBO! Throws all opponents in-range away from you (HHD)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- THROWBACK PUNCH! Throws your opponent backwards and lights them on fire (DHD)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- KNOCKOUT KICK! Weakens opponent, deals hefty damage (GGH)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">- THE ULTIMATE PLASMA FIST TECHNIQUE! Gibs opponent similarly to Ei Nath. Leaves brain. (GHDGHDH)</li>
				<li class="experiment">Plasma Fist has been added as a buyable scroll for Wizard. It costs 8 skill points due to it's sheer, powerful potential and due to the fact that you're basically buying a spell bundle. The cost is subject to change based on player feedback.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced all grab resist cooldowns from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added a sound effect and visible_message to being slammed into walls by throws</li>
				<li class="tweak">Now resisting out of pindowns will always let victim get up faster than assailant</li>
				<li class="tweak">Being tablepushed onto a glass table now gives you 5 brute and has a chance to embed the shard into you.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed teleporting issue with grabs</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds CQC, Krav Maga and Wrestling arenas to the holodeck for non-lethal practice</li>
				<li class="tweak">Recodes the way disarms work for Krav Maga and CQC AGAIN, so now it prioritizes disarming in-hand item first and if there's no item in-hand it would check the other hand.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made Wrestling Belt ignore armor for stuns so both you and your opponent are stunned for the same amount of ticks. Armor is still considered for applied damage.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made it so when your permament martial art changes you would 'forget' it like you're supposed to</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased num of ticks for sticking gun in people's mouths so you're not fucked over for a long time if you do it in combat accidentaly or something.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased medical gauze effectiveness, including the improvised gauze. Now medical gauze stops bleeding for 5 mins when makeshift does it for 2.5 mins.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Rightclick verb for creating noose was replaced with a crafting menu option when you activate the cables in-hand.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes nooses choking borgs, etc. Now nooses only work on carbons.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed flavortext for nooses misreferencing the victim and not the user when it's supposed to be vice-versa.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Nooses now give cables when cut with wirecutters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Makes screen flash mouse-opaque so you can still shoot/interact with objects while flashed. Solves the issue where you literally couldn't shoot or defend yourself in any way when flashed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Overhaul to projectile.dm - made projectiles density 0, reworked Bump proc, simplified range procs. This means that projectiles won't randomly miss you in most cases where they did, and means projectiles won't randomly hit you when they shouldn't. Thanks to /tg/ for most of these.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds nooses! You can suicide with a cable coil on top of a stool/chair/bed/toilet/table to make a noose and choke yourself to death. You can also make a noose from cables to noose SOMEONE ELSE. WARNING: Edgiest feature.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Suicide verb received an overhaul! Now all items with force have generic suicide text based on their sharpness. Also you will no longer insta-die from suiciding, so there's time to save suicide victims!</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed suicide status persisting even after being saved (this means if you attempted suicide but got saved, next time you're crit you won't count as suicide).</li>
