# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Vendomats now come stocked with 5 rolls of duct tape."
  - tweak: "The cost to make a wooden stock has been reduced from 10 planks to 1."
  - rscadd: "Improvised shotguns now require duct tape to secure the stock, not package wrap."
  - rscadd: "Modular Receivers are now craftable at any table, this means you can now craft improvised shotguns without any R&D involved."
  - tweak: "Improvised Shells and Overloaded Improvised Shells have received a much needed buff, and now do increased damage. The trade-off is they have ridiculously wide spread now. Great for lightly damaging everyone in a room, bad for taking down single targets."
  - rscadd: "A new type of ammunition, coinshot shells, are now craftable at any table and come in both regular and overloaded varieties. A painful ghetto alternative to beanbag/rubber shells."
  - tweak: "Makeshift armor no longer has slowdown."
