  - rscadd: DENTAL UPDATE! People now have teeth that can be knocked out of their
      mouths. Targeting head will have the chance to do that, targeting mouth improves
      the chances even more!
  - rscadd: 'Without teeth you will have a lisp. There''s two new surgeries added:
      teeth reinsertion surgery and dental implant surgery. Both surgeries require
      you to target mouth with surgical drapes for them to activate. Teeth reinsertion
      surgery can be performed bare-handed and doesn''t require any tools. You can
      remove teeth that way, too!'
  - rscadd: Dental implant surgery requires a drill and a pill. You will insert the
      pill into the target's mouth and the target will be able to activate the pill
      whenever they please!
  - rscadd: If you lost your original teeth you can go up to an autolathe, open up
      MEDICAL category and make some replacement teeth. They can still have dental
      implants in them.

  - rscadd: Every gun that uses magazines have been given their very own sound effects

  - tweak: Teeth are now stackable items! No longer will all 32 teeth sail off in
      an arc in a single lucky hit with a fork!
  - tweak: Now the lisp depends on the amount of missing teeth. Examine text tells
      you how much teeth are you missing.
  - tweak: The amount of teeth knocking out now depends on weapon's force. You won't
      be able to >punch< any more than ~7 teeth now unless you're hulk or something.
      Punching teeth out, however, is a better idea than to try to use a lower-brute
      weapon on them. Instead, go grab a toolbox or heck a fireaxe and apply it directly
      to the mouth for the biggest possible chance to knock dem teeth out.
  - tweak: Made collapsed rollerbeds fit in backpacks.
  - tweak: Improved 'dancing' (both people passive-grabbing each other) animation.
  - soundadd: Added RIP AND TEAR sound effect to removing embedding items.

      damage and general lack of anger in a patient. Please use them with caution

      Revolvers, Desert Eagle, Thompson, UZI/Prototype SMG, etc.)
  - tweak: MAJOR decrease in filesize for all current sounds.
  - rscadd: Ambience system reworked - now disabling ambience won't play the ambient
      loops again. Ambient loops are played on turf transitions instead of area transitions

      major spacewrecks now have unique ambient drones.

      hand (does NOT go in the gloves clothing slot), it can easily send someone across
      most rooms, dealing about 25 - 35 brute damage and 20 points of stamina damage.
      Needs to charge in between each punch, which will take approximately a second.

  - rscadd: Crew Action Figures added to the arcade machines! Collect them all.
  Crystalwarrior:
  - tweak: People who are neckgrabbed will only fall over if put in crit, knocked
      out, or killed. Have fun using them as human shields.
  Crystalwarrior160:
  - rscadd: 'Adds garrots into the game! They are similar to damp rags in functionalty,
      but have a different purpose. It''s MUCH faster to choke someone out with a
      garrot.  There are two ways to craft it:  Using table, put a single rod, 15
      cables and have a welding tool in-hand. Drag&Drop the table on yourself and
      select ''Garrote Handles''. Apply 20 cables on the created garrot handles.  Doing
      it the old-fashioned way, you need to make a wire rod, apply welder on it and
      then apply 20 cables on the created garrot handles.'
  - rscadd: 'HOW TO USE GARROTS: Step 1. Make sure you have grab intent AND are aiming
      for head.  Step 2. Click on target, switch hands, reinforce grab.  Step 3. Reinforce
      up to neckgrab if you want choking to start, reinforcing into KILL grab will
      kill your target much faster!  You can use the garrot in-hand if you already
      have a grab to garrot or stop garroting.'
  - bugfix: Damp rag and garrot are now only added to processing objects when neccesary,
      this oughta reduce lag.
  - tweak: Increased movement delay for KILL grabs so you're even less mobile.
  DerptheStewpidgoat:
  - soundadd: Ammo casings now make a little sound when they fall after being fired
      from a gun.

  - rscadd: Huge revamp of tanks(Water and fuel tanks).Now they accept any chemical,
      they'll display it on the left and you can toggle the lid out to insert them
      in through a screwdriver. They'll also spray its contents everywhere if shot,
      and trigger an heat-reaction if welded.
  - tweak: Water/lube will make a floor slippable depending on how many units you
      use.One unit means it'll wear out easily, more than 10 means the old time.
  Chronitonity:
  - tweak: Syringes, IVs, and other injectiables now use INJECT as a method of applying
      chems, instead of INJEST.
  - rscadd: Saline-Glucose Solution can be used as a substitute blood replacement
      if injected, either by syringe or IV drip. It isn't as effective as normal blood,
      but can be used in a pinch, or to 'water down' blood to make it last longer.
  - tweak: Traitors poison kit now starts with a syringe.
  Crystalwarrior160:
  - bugfix: Fixed trying to catch embeddable items still allowing them to embed in
      you first.
  - rscadd: 'DUCT TAPE IS BACK BABY! You can tape people''s mouths if you aim at head.
      Here''s all the things you can craft, too:'

      6 duct tape on the table.'
  - tweak: Now if you're dragged across glass shards they can embed in you. Also,
      if you're laying down, uniform will protect you instead of shoes.
  - tgs: Weapons and projectiles that are armour piercing now have an increased chance
      to bypass riot shields (Thanks to KorPhaeron for this one!)
  - tgs: Sped up recursive_hear_check (Thanks to tkdrg for this one!)

  - tweak: Re-added the short charge time for power fists to make them less of an
      E-Z super mass-genocide glove.
  - rscadd: Strange new animal crate orderable from cargo for 25 TC. It's available
      in the Food & Livestock section.
  - tweak: Made wheelchairs move a bit faster.
2015-11-15:
  Chronitonity:
  - rscadd: Standardises spacesuit and hardsuit slowdown from 2 to 1.
  DerptheStewpidgoat:
  - tweak: Lowered wheelchair speed so that they are no longer retard-fast rockets,
      but are still faster than they previously were.
  - tweak: Power fist code changed greatly to make it perform better to cause less
      lag on the server.
  - tweak: Power fist cooldown has been readded BUT it uses a different system so
      that rather than having a random 0 - 2 second cooldown which was very unreliable
      you now only have a slightly-longer-than-normal cooldown which is practically
      always the same. New cool-down system also lets admins set the cooldown to literally
      0 so they can pulverize someone as fast as they can click.
  - tweak: Power fist now takes armor into account and no longer does stamina damage
      but can punch through any kind of window or grille instantly. Power fist cost
      has NOT been changed.

      (Mauser C96) chambered in .45 ACP, P057A Luger (PO-8 Luger) chambered in .357,
      and .44 Automag chambered in .44 AMP. Credits to Nienhaus for the majority of
      the sprites.
  - rscadd: All guns except for the automag are currently summon-guns exclusive. A
      single automag spawns on the bar counter with the nuke ops leader. It has a
      7-round magazine and does a very formidable amount of damage. Also has some
      armor-piercing traits which makes it dangerous even to users of a bulletproof
      vest. The ammo that comes with the automag is the only ammo that nuke ops can
      ever get for it, so it is advised that you conserve your ammo.
  Pyko:
  - bugfix: Fixed some of the reagent dispensers being un-anchored and dense
  - tweak: Bar/kitchen shutters now have same access as bar/kitchen door.

  - rscadd: 'Ported a bunch of things from Facepunch, which includes: ASS Operative
      armor, Blood Raven armor + chainsword, and gib gun.'
  - rscadd: All of these are admin-spawn exclusive except for the gib-gun, which can
      be spawned from summon-guns or found at the CentCom emergency shuttle dock.
  - rscadd: 'Admins, there are two new selectable equipment options: ASS Operative
      and Blood Raven Space Marine.'
  McHatters:
  - rscadd: Big Papa's snazzy purple hat, zoot suit, and pimp stick have made their

      worthwhile to create and use.
  - rscadd: 'Two new poisons: Heparin and Teslium!'

      the victim bleed uncontrollably and deals minor brute damage.

  Crystalwarrior160:
  - experimental: Complete changeling rework! Now changeling abilities are divided
      into tiers based on required amount of absorbtions to unlock them. You start
      with 5 Evolution Points by default and have access to Tier 1, which includes
      various stings. You also have lesser form and mimic voice abilities from the
      start.
  - experimental: This is a VERY experimental update, and all player feedback is much
      appreciated!
  - imageadd: New Changeling UI sprites by Fury McFlurry! Go make him a cake or something.
  - rscremove: Removed Changeling Shield, Chitinous Armor and Extract DNA sting
  - rscremove: Removed Changeling team objectives
  - rscadd: Added synaptic enhancement as a changeling ability. When active, this
      will halve the delay between actions such as attacking.
  - rscadd: Paralysis Sting has been re-added and revamped. After a short delay based
      on the victim's health, they will be knocked down for fifteen seconds.
  - rscadd: Death Sting has been re-added and revamped. It will inject them with a
      small dosage of Wasting Toxin with slow metabolization rate, which will slowly
      drain blood and deal toxin damage to the victim.
  - rscadd: Horror Form has been added. When used, this will transform the changeling
      into their powerful true form, able to deal powerful damage, crawl through vents,
      and tear into living and dead humans to heal themselves. They will be incapable
      of returning to a human for three minutes, and when they do, are stunned for
      ten seconds. Death will automatically turn them back into humans and knock them
      out for thirty seconds.
  - tweak: Chameleon ability for Changelings now makes them invisible to mouse cursor
      when they're completely invisible.
  - tweak: Chameleon ability has been sped up slightly.
  - tweak: Evolution points have received a large rebalance. Changelings now start
      with five points, and will gain two more after each absorption. Some abilities
      take more than five points to unlock, meaning powerful abilities like Fleshmend
      will be locked by default. If a changeling absorbs another changeling, the absorber
      will gain the other's remaining genetic points.
  - tweak: There is now no limit on genomes storable for transformation. This means
      that you will be able to transform into anyone you have absorbed past the first
      six.
  - tweak: Mute Sting now functions based on the Mute Toxin reagent and lasts for
      much shorter.
  - tweak: Blind Sting now confuses the victim for a short duration.
  - tweak: All stings but transformation sting no longer function on the dead. Cryogenic
      Sting now only works on conscious targets.

      you from equipping the real deal

      very good throwforce. Nuke Ops start with combat knives.
  - rscadd: Made combat knives and seclites attachable to many things, including assault
      rifles and bulldog shotgun
  - bugfix: Fixed species teeth not working correctly
  - rscadd: '!!MASSIVE MARTIAL ARTS REWORK!!'
  - rscadd: ===
  - rscdel: Pinning people down is no longer possible unless you have an appropriate
      martial art.
  - experiment: Security Officers, including the Detective, now spawn with a Krav
      Maga Martial Art! Krav Maga martial art functions differently from it's /tg/
      counterpart. Hippie Station's version lets you pin people down, as well as perform
      robust disarms that instantly put the weapon in your hands.
  - rscadd: '- You can now perform a pindown if you attack your opponent with grab
      item, with disarm intent, in AGGRESSIVE grab stage.'
  - rscadd: 'Ported Atlas Station wrestling with a bunch of tweaks! There are too
      many possible moves that you can perform to list their executions here, but,
      here''s what you can do:'
  - rscadd: '- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance), Backhand Chop, Chop Drop, Choke Slam,
      Back Breaker, Moonsault, Corkscrew Elbow Drop, Suplex, Tombstone Piledriver,
      Cutter/RKO and finally, the Powerbomb!'
  - rscadd: Completely rewritten the CQC martial art to be more faithful to the Metal
      Gear franchise, as well as making it very viable in 1v1 surprise attacks.
  - rscadd: 'Current CQC moves:'
  - rscadd: '- Clinch (50% Aggro Grab chance)'
  - rscadd: '- Roundhouse Kick (5-hit combo, KO)'
  - rscadd: '- Face Slam (Neck Grab + Harm Intent + attack w/ grab, KO, small brute)'
  - rscadd: '- Robust Disarm (Same as Krav Maga - instantly puts weapon in-hand, sacrifices
      push down chance)'
  - rscadd: '- Karate Chop (Neck Grab + Disarm Intent + attack w/ grab, +20 Staminaloss,
      makes victim confused)'
  - rscadd: '- Half-wing choke (Replaces choking, twice as fast to perform, adds +20
      staminaloss on attempt)'
  - rscadd: Plasma Fist Martial Art was completely rewritten to make your punches
      MUCH faster, but some combos are harder to execute!
  - rscadd: 'Current Plasma Fist moves (H = Harm, D = Disarm, G = Grab):'
  - rscadd: '- TORNADO COMBO! Throws all opponents in-range away from you (HHD)'
  - rscadd: '- THROWBACK PUNCH! Throws your opponent backwards and lights them on
      fire (DHD)'
  - rscadd: '- KNOCKOUT KICK! Weakens opponent, deals hefty damage (GGH)'
  - rscadd: '- THE ULTIMATE PLASMA FIST TECHNIQUE! Gibs opponent similarly to Ei Nath.
      Leaves brain. (GHDGHDH)'
  - experiment: Plasma Fist has been added as a buyable scroll for Wizard. It costs
      8 skill points due to it's sheer, powerful potential and due to the fact that
      you're basically buying a spell bundle. The cost is subject to change based
      on player feedback.
  - tweak: Reduced all grab resist cooldowns from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
  - tweak: Added a sound effect and visible_message to being slammed into walls by
      throws
  - tweak: Now resisting out of pindowns will always let victim get up faster than
      assailant
  - tweak: Being tablepushed onto a glass table now gives you 5 brute and has a chance
      to embed the shard into you.
  - bugfix: Fixed teleporting issue with grabs
  - rscadd: Adds CQC, Krav Maga and Wrestling arenas to the holodeck for non-lethal
      practice
  - tweak: Recodes the way disarms work for Krav Maga and CQC AGAIN, so now it prioritizes
      disarming in-hand item first and if there's no item in-hand it would check the
      other hand.
  - tweak: Made Wrestling Belt ignore armor for stuns so both you and your opponent
      are stunned for the same amount of ticks. Armor is still considered for applied
      damage.
  - bugfix: Made it so when your permament martial art changes you would 'forget'
      it like you're supposed to
  - tweak: Increased num of ticks for sticking gun in people's mouths so you're not
      fucked over for a long time if you do it in combat accidentaly or something.
  - tweak: Increased medical gauze effectiveness, including the improvised gauze.
      Now medical gauze stops bleeding for 5 mins when makeshift does it for 2.5 mins.

  - bugfix: Fixed pocket fire extinguisher not having a hitsound
  - bugfix: Fixed aliens and other mobs being able to 'crit crawl' where it would
      rapidly drain their oxyloss. Fixes alien crit.

      when it's supposed to be vice-versa.
  - bugfix: Nooses now give cables when cut with wirecutters.
  - tweak: Makes screen flash mouse-opaque so you can still shoot/interact with objects
      while flashed. Solves the issue where you literally couldn't shoot or defend
      yourself in any way when flashed.
  - bugfix: Overhaul to projectile.dm - made projectiles density 0, reworked Bump
      proc, simplified range procs. This means that projectiles won't randomly miss
      you in most cases where they did, and means projectiles won't randomly hit you
      when they shouldn't. Thanks to /tg/ for most of these.
  - rscadd: 'Adds nooses! You can suicide with a cable coil on top of a stool/chair/bed/toilet/table
      to make a noose and choke yourself to death. You can also make a noose from
      cables to noose SOMEONE ELSE. WARNING: Edgiest feature.'
  - tweak: Suicide verb received an overhaul! Now all items with force have generic
      suicide text based on their sharpness. Also you will no longer insta-die from
      suiciding, so there's time to save suicide victims!
  - bugfix: Fixed suicide status persisting even after being saved (this means if
      you attempted suicide but got saved, next time you're crit you won't count as
      suicide).
  - rscadd: Added hotkeys for changing your limb targeting zone to the numpad. (Thanks
      to Delimusca for this!)
  - rscadd: Adds antag hud for player zombies + lets zombies see infected people
  - tweak: You will no longer transform into a Zombie if you're alive. Zombie virus
      now requires you to be dead for transformation to happen.
  - tweak: Zombies now fully take the armor into account. If you see a zombie with
      ablative armor chances are lasers won't do as much damage to it.
  - tweak: Made zombie bites warn the zombie whether or not the infection passed -
      this helps convey to zombies that biosuits/spacesuits have a chance to protect
      against bites.
  - tweak: You can now infect dead people as a zombie.
  - bugfix: Fixes some bugs with reposession of zombies
  DerptheStewpidGoat:
  - bugfix: The automatic laser carbine's magazine can now be made in the protolathe.
  - bugfix: Solved some technical difficulties with the gateway.
  - rscadd: The gateway is now functional once again, with /tg/'s latest Z-levels
      also being included. The gateway can be found at its original location, and
      will allow for the crew to travel to a randomly-selected away-mission about
      15 or so minutes after round-start. All credits to /tg/.
  - rscadd: Added the new Strider 40mm Multi-Grenade-Launcher for nuke ops. Can hold
      six 40mm grenades and costs 25 TC. Can also appear from summon guns. Credits
      to Dr. / Sgt. Fragg for the sprite.
  - rscadd: Added the new Elite Syndicate Hardsuit for nuke ops. Has moderately better
      armory in every category against damage and is immune to fire and highly effective

  - bugfix: The pulse rifle now has proper on-back icons once again, along with using
      pre-rebase fire sounds.

  - bugfix: The AKS-740U is now on the wild west map for real this time and can now
      appear from summon guns.
  - bugfix: Fixed various bugs that were introduced with the gameplay update. Z-levels
      no longer have an X-axis extending to 510 tiles, shadowlings -should- be able
      to use all their abilities again, and wizards can no longer revive from death
      via lichdom through ghosting. Also made the asset caching more efficient, but
      it still needs work. Credits to /tg/ for the asset cache improvements and map
      X-axis fix.
  - rscadd: Added the new AKS-740U carbine. It is similar to the AK-922, but fires
      the lower caliber 5.45x39mm round.
  - rscadd: New sprites for the Automatic Laser Carbine. Credits to Dr. / Sgt. Fragg
      for the sprites.
  - tweak: Polished up the Wild West away mission to give it some more detail. Also
      added a C05-R, Luger, Automag, Mac-10, and AKS-740U to the map. Additionally,
      fixed the invincible windows.
  DerptheStewpidgoat:
  - rcsadd: Added Temmie. Temmie can also be summoned by badmins through the temmierune
      subtype of the golemrune, via the create object panel.
  - rcsadd: Ported a ton of misc. fixes and some features from /tg/. Notably, you
      use alt-click on the AI holopads to summon the AI now, and escape pods can now
      be launched to the asteroid during red and delta level security alerts. Pods
      launched in this manner will not travel to Centcomm at the end of the round.
      Credits to KorPhaeron for this.
  - rcsadd: Each pod is now equipped with a safe that contains two emergency space
      suits and mining pickaxes. This safe will only open during red or delta level
      security alerts.

      https://github.com/HippieStationCode/HippieStation13/pull/1311 '

      plasma cartridges in 24-round magazines. Can also fire in bursts of 3. Hint:
      it needs combat level 6 research, among some other research levels.'
  - tweak: Made the H.E.V set cost a moderate amount less of materials and required
      research levels. Also made the modular receiver need lower research levels and
      less metal to be made. Modular receiver also no longer needs silver.
  - tweak: New gorka on-mob icons so it looks less like ass. Also resprited the camo
      boots a bit to go better with the gorka uniform. Thanks to Sgt. Fragg for the
      new gorka uniform on-mob sprites. Additionally, also thanks to them for the
      entirety of the sprite work on the chest rig, defender armor, and gorka uniform.

      by Calomel, and your view is restored to normal
2015-12-06:

      spooky. Ctrl+S or *scream work.

      bundle.
  - rscadd: Nuclear Operative leaders can now buy an item that announces that they're

  - rscadd: Gun Renovation for Nuke Ops!.
  - rscadd: Nuke Op guns are now cheaper to compensate for not starting with shotguns.

      balls that generate more power!

      the engine is, especiall when freed.

      equal to that of deathsquad armor. The XMG80 assault rifle fires 6.8x43mm caseless
      ammunition from a 48-round magazine. The XMG80 can be spawned from summon guns.
      The sprite is based on a G36 but in a bullpup configuration for those curious.
      Thanks to Sgt. Fragg for the XMG80 sprites, and thanks to Fury McFlurry for
      the armor and clothing sprites.

      experience
  - rscadd: Turned a bit of space in Engineering into a materials room, just to give

      in towels, hi-five and generally be homo-erotic.

  - experiment: DISMEMBERMENT IS NOW A THING! No, I'm not joking! Now you can chop
      people's limbs off if you reach that limb's maxcap damage (75 for arms and legs,
      200 for chest/head). You cannot dismember chest, obviously (but you will completely
      disembowel it!)

      Enjoy your gore you sick bastards!

      you perform this quick surgery on it:'
  - rscadd: 'Limb manipulation surgery! It has 3 modes: Mend wound/muscles at first
      step, OR: incise -> retract skin -> clamp bleeders -> either: SAW THE LIMB OFF,
      MAKE AN INCISION (sever muscles for augmenting) or MEND THE WOUND (ends surgery,
      fixes muscles)'
  - rscadd: DECAPITATION! Before you freak out, it will never happen when you're still
      alive. Most likely it'll happen on either the final blow or when you're already

      be pulled. They can have their brain removed via surgical saw, armblade or other
      implements viable in debrain surgery.

      with a cane/staff/item which lets you crutch walk!
  - rscadd: Limb plants! Hydroponics now start with 3 limbplant seeds. Limb plants,
      when harvested, produce a bunch of limb plant items. You cannot consume them,
      but they can be picked apart by activating them in-hand. This will produce a
      random limb - an arm or a leg.
  - rscadd: Changeling fleshmend can now regenerate limbs - however, it makes a loud
      noise and forces the changeling to scream.
  - bugfix: Thrown items now embed at their respective target zone (means if you throw
      a rod at someone's head it won't end up in their leg 99% of the time.)
  - bugfix: Fixed a lot of SHARP flags missing on swords, especially cult blade/katana/e-swords/etc.

  - tweak: " + Tray Shield:\t\t\tmelee = 60, bullet = 50, laser = 40, energy = 30\
      \ (Now trayshields break based on the amount of taken damage overall, making\
      \ them less RNG and more reliable)"
  - tweak: " + Bo Staff:\t\t\tmelee = 50, bullet = 50, laser = 50, energy = 50"
  - tweak: " + Riot Shield:\t\t\tmelee = 70, bullet = 60, laser = 40, energy = 30\
      \ (Added slowdown when deployed, can be deployed similar to telescopic/energy\
      \ shield)"
  - tweak: " + Energy Shield:\t\tmelee = 60, bullet = 70, laser = 60, energy = 40\
      \ (still 100% reflect chance on energy projectiles tho)"
  - tweak: " + Telescopic Shield:\tmelee = 50, bullet = 30, laser = 20, energy = 20"

      battery panel (you have to do that with wirecutters now)
  - bugfix: Fixed health scanners straight up not working
  - bugfix: Fixed infrared sensors having extremely odd behaviour
  - bugfix: Fixed all assembly time mechanisms taking twice as long than they should
      (if you set your timer to, like, 6 seconds, it'll actually tick down like you
      expect it to instead of it taking 12 seconds)
  - tweak: Moved assemblies to their own category on the autolathe
  - tweak: Tweaked button animations to use flick() proc (they will no longer have
      odd timing)
  - tweak: Opening doors via the respective wire no longer requires ID wires to be
      cut (this makes door-opening assemblies not completely useless if you don't
      want assistants barging into places)
  - rscadd: Added keypads! You can craft a keypad frame using metal. To construct
      it, you need to activate the assembly in-hand to set the password. If you want
      to reset the password you have to use the multitool on the assembly. Then, attach
      it to a wall, wire it and insert assemblies into it to be used when the password
      input is correct and when it's wrong. Screw the cover shut and viola!
  - rscadd: Frightbots and Screambots are added to the game! If you remember them
      pre-rebase, well, they're better than ever!
  - rscadd: Frightbots now have an emag function. Emag them and their scary stories
      will have a phyiscal effect on all people nearby!
  - rscadd: 'To make frightbots: Get some metal to make a chasis, stuff a station-bounced
      radio into them.'
  - rscadd: 'To make screambots: Make a screambot chasis, apply welder, apply cyborg
      arm.'

      headslug if you're MMI'd or decapitated.
  - rscdel: Removed comatose sting (2 FULL MINUTES OF UTTER AND COMPLETE HELPNESSNESS
      IS NOT OKAY), reverted death sting back to the original (wasting toxin instead
      of venom, tier 3)
  - tweak: Tweaks changeling headslug timing to be more accurate
  - tweak: Reduced recommended_enemies on both Traitor and Changeling gamemodes to
      2 so they're more lowpop-friendly
  - tweak: Tweaked changeling regeneration to use revive() proc
  - tweak: Increased headslug speed to be the same as humans so you're not a complete
      joke.
  - tweak: Tweaked absorbtions to not work on NPC humans (monkey-humans/mind datum-less
      humans)
  - tweak: Para-sting no longer alerts the victim of being stung until they're stunned
  - tweak: Better chameleon skin animations, chameleon skin now takes less time to
      turn fully invisible (approx. 3 seconds)
  - tweak: Reduced point cost for syanptic enhancement
  - tweak: Removed death sting, added purge sting for chemical purging

      in addition to regular damage. The lighter and more blunt the item is, the more

      delay to deploy.

  - rscdel: Medical Cyborgs no longer have bicardine, kelotane, anti-toxin and dexalin.
  - rscadd: Medical Cyborgs now have tricordrazine in their place.

2016-08-11:
  Gandalf2k15:
  - rscadd: Adds a new spawning space junk asteroid to space!
  Kierany9:
  - tweak: Atropine and Tricordizane now have to be heated to 370k to mix. This is
      to prevent unintentional mixing of these chems.
  - rscadd: Adds Sleep Toxin to the sleepers. It sends people to sleep slightly slower
      than Chloral Hydrate but is completely harmless. It is made with 1 part Chloral
      4 parts Sugar.
  - tweak: Morphine no longer sends people to sleep unless they are below 30 HP, making
      it actually worthwhile to use as it completely bypasses all slowdowns from either
      damage or heavy gear, although you are unable to tell how wounded you are. Sleepers
      must be upgraded once to dispense morphine.
  - rscadd: Morphine can now be created with 1 part Nitrogen 1 part Sleep Toxin 1
      part Oil.
  - rscadd: Added Heroin. Made by heating Morphine, Cyanide, Epinephrine and Potassium
      to 420k, it grants full immunity to slowdown just like morphine but also grants
      infinite stamina as well as healing brute and burn damage. However, it doubles
      the duration of unresisted stuns.
  - tweak: Poppies now contain Morphine instead of Saline, and at higher potencies,
      Heroin.
  - experiment: Changed the way anti-stun chemicals worked completely. You must spend
      a short amount of time without being stunned, after that, you gain extreme stun
      resistance for up to two stuns, after which you must wait again to regain the
      resistance. During a stun, the chemical metabolizes much faster. This makes
      chemicals much more robust agaist single stuns, but leave you completely vulnerable
      to repeat attacks and stunlock attempts. Check the wiki for detailed info on
      each chemical.
  - tweak: Morphine doubles the amount of time needed to regain stun resistance, as
      does overdosing on the chemical in question with the exception of Bath Salts.
  - tweak: Anti-stun chemicals now help wake people up faster.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the IGNORESLOWDOWN bitflag would ignore any speedboosts
      granted.
  - tweak: Refactored the code for chemical speed boosts. This won't affect gameplay
      but will make coding them significantly easier and less buggy.
  - bugfix: Fixed morphine pills instantly overdosing you, as well as reducing the
      unnecessarily ridiculous amount of mannitol, mutadone and charcoal in their
      respective pills from 50 to 15u.
  - tweak: Made a couple of medvend items contraband including atropine and diphenhydramine.
  - tweak: The Wrestling Belt and CQC Gloves have been reduced from 12 TC to 5 TC
      and 7 TC respectively.
  Kierany9 -NEW GAMEMODE-:
  - rscadd: The brand new Hippie-exclusive gamemode, KING OF THE DISK is here! Check
      the wiki for more information.
  - wip: In King of the Disk, all the traitors are given a pinpointer and tasked with
      stealing the nuke disk. For every minute a traitor spends with the nuke disk
      in his possession, he gains an extra telecrystal. Escape with either the disk
      or the most TC out of all traitors to win.
  - wip: The traitor uplink is somewhat limited in this mode, you start with 10 TC
      and the Ebow, Revolver, Bundles and Surplus Crates are not available. The Emag
      also costs 8 TC instead of 6 in this gamemode.
  Kokojo:
  - bugfix: Borgs floaters are no longer activable by humans everywhere, just in the
      pool.
  - tweak: Maintenance doors now become all-access when radiation storm hits.
  McBawbaggings:
  - rscdel: Removed bluespace shelter capsule.
2016-08-15:
  Gandalf Greyhame:
  - rscadd: There are now 5 more stacks of wire in derelict EVA. Happy repairing.
  Kierany9:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug in King of the Disk where the disk would not grant extra telecrystals
      when stored in bags.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where mindslaves holding the disk would receive messages about
      receiving telecrystals instead of the person who implanted them.
  - bugfix: The PDA uplink now automatically refreshes when the holder gains extra
      TC.
2016-08-16:
  Carbonhell:
  - rscadd: Adds crew objectives. When joining, all jobs excluding silicons and antags
      will get an objective related to their job to accomplish. At roundend, the successful
      crewmembers are listed along, and the department with the most successful crewmembers
      is also listed. Obviously, those objectives do NOT make you an antagonist.
  - bugfix: Fixes the chemicals' addiction messages.
  - bugfix: Fixes masks overlays staying after an human has been decapitated.
  - bugfix: Fixes certain antag types still getting crew objectives.
  - rscdel: ERT engineers no longer spawn with a medkit in their hands.

      hold it, not just mobs.
  Kierany9:
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where Strained Muscles could remove bitflags incorrectly,
      applying random flags such as godmode.
  - bugfix: We have recently noticed that the Syndicate, in collaboration Wizards
      Federation, have sabotaged all NanoTrasen brand freezers by adding miniature
      power sinks inside of them. We have replaced these defective units, they will
      no longer instantly drain APCs, nor cause gases to defy the third law of thermodynamics,
      when upgraded.
  - tweak: King of the Disk now needs 35 players to start instead of 45.
2016-08-30:

  Banthebantz:
  - rscadd: Added Cryogenic Fluid an advanced firefighting chemical which can freeze
      people in place and cause severe stamina damage and cold burns in doses 5u or
      greater, pretty terrible if ingested though. Made with 4 cryostylane, 1 pyrosium,
      1 lube
  Kierany9:
  - rscdel: Removed all .357 revolvers from space and replaced them with other items.
  - tweak: Ranged russians now exclusively carry mosins, and melee russians now carry
      combat knives.
  McBawbaggings:
  - rscadd: You can now toggle freezing botany trays with the multitool. This will
      prevent the plant from growing, using resources, weeds taking over and other
      general interaction with it. You can still use plant scanners while frozen.
  - bugfix: Fixed dakis going invisible after selecting a daki body.
  - bugfix: Fixed being able to change the body of a daki provided you gave it a null
      name.
  - bugfix: No longer adds empty spaces in the name of dakis if no name is given.

  Spacedong:

      with all the recipes eventually.

      containing a variety of special shells including syndicate exclusives
  Blobbernaut:
  - bugfix: Fixed cloaks not being switchable.
  - bugfix: Fixed captain's gloves not having a sprite.
  - rscadd: Turns out I forgot the changelog when I did this! The way armor is calculated
      has been updated. It now stacks multiplicatively. This means it is impossible
      for you to reach 100 armor, and thus full protection, by wearing different pieces
      of armor. Something that has 40 armor will reduce the damage by 40%, no matter
      what else you're wearing.
  - rscadd: Several of the changes include slight buffs to sec jumpsuits (The previous
      change nerfed them slightly, this normalizes them to how they were) and science
      labcoats, as well as giving cloaks an armor value even when worn on the back.
  - rscadd: You switch a cloak between being wearable on your back or chest slot by
      clicking it in your active hand after emptying it.
  - rscadd: Slime drain damage and xeno neurotoxin are now reduced by a suit's bio
      protection. Labcoats give a little, hardsuits and bio suits give full protection!
      No more annoying clone damage, scientists.
  - rscadd: The way bomb damage interacts with armor has also been changed. Paralyze
      chance, dismemberment chance, and damage are all now reduced substantially with
      armor. Blast protection on the head or chest counts extra for reducing damage
      and stun time. A bomb suit will even completely protect you from light explosions
      and all dismemberment.
  - rscadd: Allows accessories to be given armor. Currently, the captain's medal has
      5 armor for each type. This just adds it to the jumpsuit's armor.
  McBawbaggings:
  - bugfix: Microwaves no longer break forever.
  - tweak: Gibber meat now comes out the left of it instead of all over the place.
  - bugfix: Fixed bolt of change turning people into drones without restrictions.

      wizard.'
