delete-after: True

changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed relics not working properly on limbs. Relics now properly do a snapshot of the item they're copying, too."
  - tweak: "Streamlined inventory system a bit - "
  - tweak: "  You can now click the toggle-clothes-UI thing in the bottom left corner with clothing in-hand to quick switch that clothing for yourself! (quick-switching uniforms will still empty out your pockets, etc.)"
  - tweak: "  You can now click with most storage items in-hand to store target item in it"
  - tweak: "  You can now alt-click storage items to check their contents without picking it up (makes drag&drop more useful for actual dumping so there's less accidental emptying out)"
  - tweak: "  Added a new 'Attack Inactive Hand' mob verb and a keybind! Press C or Ctrl+C to 'click' something in your inactive hand with your active hand. You can also 'swap hands' for items with this, essentially!"
