# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Melee damage has been overhauled so that most weapons deal stamina damage in addition to regular damage. The lighter and more blunt the item is, the more stamina damage it will deal. The inverse is true for heavy and sharp items. Now you can beat down chucklefucks without critting them the majority of the time."
  - rscadd: "There is now a seperate hud indicator for stamina, it basically tracks how close you are to falling over, whether from your injuries or stamina loss. The health indicator tracks your real damage and disregards stamina loss."
  - wip: "Special thanks to Kierany9 for his contributions, and to Kokojo, TDCoolguy and Zadeon for laying out the groundwork for this idea. You guys rock."
