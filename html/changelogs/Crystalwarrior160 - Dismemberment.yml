changes:
  - experiment: "DISMEMBERMENT IS NOW A THING! No, I'm not joking! Now you can chop people's limbs off if you reach that limb's maxcap damage (75 for arms and legs, 200 for chest/head). You cannot dismember chest, obviously (but you will completely disembowel it!)"
  - soundadd: "JUICY! GORE! SOUND EFFECTS! Blood splatters now have fancy SFX, too! Enjoy your gore you sick bastards!"
  - rscadd: "Your limbs become AUGMENTABLE once they come off, aka their muscles are severed. You can pick your limb up and reattach it but it won't be usable unless you perform this quick surgery on it:"
  - rscadd: "Limb manipulation surgery! It has 3 modes: Mend wound/muscles at first step, OR: incise -> retract skin -> clamp bleeders -> either: SAW THE LIMB OFF, MAKE AN INCISION (sever muscles for augmenting) or MEND THE WOUND (ends surgery, fixes muscles)"
  - rscadd: "DECAPITATION! Before you freak out, it will never happen when you're still alive. Most likely it'll happen on either the final blow or when you're already dead! Heads apply slight slowdown, cannot be stuffed in backpacks and cannot be pulled. They can have their brain removed via surgical saw, armblade or other implements viable in debrain surgery."
  - rscadd: "Health doll properly displays severed muscles/missing limbs. Your hands will be blocked if you're missing that respecitve arm."
  - rscadd: "Some species have no dismemberment, like Shadowlings, Slimes, Jelly people and Golems. And meeseeks."
  - rscadd: "You can crawl when both of your legs are missing. Wheelchairs fully supported."
  - rscadd: "If a single leg is missing you'll have major slowdown, which can be negated with a cane/staff/item which lets you crutch walk!"
  - rscadd: "Limb plants! Hydroponics now start with 3 limbplant seeds. Limb plants, when harvested, produce a bunch of limb plant items. You cannot consume them, but they can be picked apart by activating them in-hand. This will produce a random limb - an arm or a leg."
  - rscadd: "Changeling fleshmend can now regenerate limbs - however, it makes a loud noise and forces the changeling to scream."
  - bugfix: "Thrown items now embed at their respective target zone (means if you throw a rod at someone's head it won't end up in their leg 99% of the time.)"
  - bugfix: "Fixed a lot of SHARP flags missing on swords, especially cult blade/katana/e-swords/etc."
