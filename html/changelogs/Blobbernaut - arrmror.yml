# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed cloaks not being switchable."
  - bugfix: "Fixed captain's gloves not having a sprite."
  - rscadd: "Turns out I forgot the changelog when I did this! The way armor is calculated has been updated. It now stacks multiplicatively. This means it is impossible for you to reach 100 armor, and thus full protection, by wearing different pieces of armor. Something that has 40 armor will reduce the damage by 40%, no matter what else you're wearing."
  - rscadd: "Several of the changes include slight buffs to sec jumpsuits (The previous change nerfed them slightly, this normalizes them to how they were) and science labcoats, as well as giving cloaks an armor value even when worn on the back."
  - rscadd: "You switch a cloak between being wearable on your back or chest slot by clicking it in your active hand after emptying it."
  - rscadd: "Slime drain damage and xeno neurotoxin are now reduced by a suit's bio protection. Labcoats give a little, hardsuits and bio suits give full protection! No more annoying clone damage, scientists."
  - rscadd: "The way bomb damage interacts with armor has also been changed. Paralyze chance, dismemberment chance, and damage are all now reduced substantially with armor. Blast protection on the head or chest counts extra for reducing damage and stun time. A bomb suit will even completely protect you from light explosions and all dismemberment."
  - rscadd: "Allows accessories to be given armor. Currently, the captain's medal has 5 armor for each type. This just adds it to the jumpsuit's armor."
