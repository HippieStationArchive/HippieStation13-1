changes:
  - experiment: "Bloodloss has now become a seperate damage variable on organs as opposed to something determined by brute damage! This means that sharp weapons are more likely to cause bleeding than blunt."
  - tweak: "Most knives have been given an \"IS_SHARP_ACCURATE\" tag, which lets you use these knives to cut food + it has an additional bleeding buff. Scalpel also has this tag, for the record."
  - tweak: "Medical Analyzers interface has been given a slight overhaul. Damage reports are now properly tabulated, bleed variable is now visible on limbs. It determines the amount of blood lost every tick (2 seconds). Max bloodloss for every individual limb is 2."
  - tweak: "Styptic Patches now completely heal bloodloss. Bruise packs remove 1 point of bloodloss."
  - tweak: "Buffed iron reagent to restore 0.6u of blood every tick instead of 0.4u. Nutriment still restores 0.4u. What this means is that if you use iron + eat something you'll restore 1u of blood every tick (2 seconds)."
  - tweak: "Most injected reagents and a bunch of other items (like mediguns/bibles) heal a small bit of bloodloss as well."
  - tweak: "IV drips have been sped up slightly to restore 15u of blood instead of 10u every tick"
  - tweak: "If your limb has 0 brute damage it will no longer have bloodloss"
  - tweak: "Cautery and Welding Tool both can close up bleeding wounds. Completely healing the brute damage on a limb will also remove bloodloss."
  - tweak: "Embedded objects now cause bloodloss on limb instead of being hard-checked by blood code."
  - rscadd: "Surgery freezer now has 2 of each blood type + 3 random bloodtype bloodpacks. Empty bloodpacks are removed because nobody will fuckin donate blood on this server."
