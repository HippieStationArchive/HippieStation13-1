changes: 
  - soundadd: "Major sound update! Lots of things that were missing sounds now have ones. Zippo lighters, lighters, flares, flashlights, lightswitches, as well as new hitsounds for crowbars, wrenches, (non-energy) swords, armblade and MORE!"
  - soundadd: "Added more gunshot sounds to unique ballistic weapons (SAW LMG, Mateba, Revolvers, Desert Eagle, Thompson, UZI/Prototype SMG, etc.)"
  - tweak: "MAJOR decrease in filesize for all current sounds."
  - rscadd: "Ambience system reworked - now disabling ambience won't play the ambient loops again. Ambient loops are played on turf transitions instead of area transitions now for the sake of space ambient loop. LOTS of new ambient loops added, most major spacewrecks now have unique ambient drones."
