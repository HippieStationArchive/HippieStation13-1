  - rscadd: "Powerfist added! It's available to any traitor for 14 TC. When held in hand (does NOT go in the gloves clothing slot), it can easily send someone across most rooms, dealing about 25 - 35 brute damage and 20 points of stamina damage. Needs to charge in between each punch, which will take approximately a second."
