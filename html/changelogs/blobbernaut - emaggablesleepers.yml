# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.  
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.  
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.  
changes:   
  - bugfix: "Sleeper pods will no longer allow you to overdose people on healing drugs when upgraded"  
  - rscadd: "Sleeper pods now have an emag option. Emagging allows you to inject a lot of chemicals quickly, and greatly increases the limit to how much can be injected, which further increases with tech level."  
  - rscadd: "The emag option also has a 2% chance to change the list of injectables to a completely different set of a few 'fun' chemicals."  
  - rscdel: "Temporarily removes meeseeks boxes from the spawn pool"  
  - experiment: "Superfart damage changed to 50"
