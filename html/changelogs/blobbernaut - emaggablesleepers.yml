36    -  - bugfix: "Sleeper pods will no longer allow you to overdose people on healing drugs when upgraded"

38    -  - rscadd: "The emag option also has a 2% chance to change the list of injectables to a completely different set of a few 'fun' chemicals."  
39    -  - rscdel: "Temporarily removes meeseeks boxes from the spawn pool"  
40    -  - experiment: "Superfart damage changed to 50"
