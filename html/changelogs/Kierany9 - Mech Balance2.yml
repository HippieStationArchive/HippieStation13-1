changes: 
  - rscadd: "Brought back some mech rebalancing that was reverted by accident. Most mech weapons are now superior in some way to their non-mounted counterparts and mech ballistics are no-longer a complete joke."
  - rscadd: "Added the RTC \"Detainer\" repeating disabler, a mech-mounted disabler that fires a three-shot burst, enough to keep anybody hit by it on the ground."
  - tweak: "The CH-PS \"Immolator\" Laser is now the default mech weapon, the Ultra AC 2 LMG has received a significiant buff and placed behind a research wall."
