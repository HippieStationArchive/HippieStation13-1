changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed inactive shields (teleshields, energy shields) still blocking projectiles even when inactive"
  - tweak: "Shields now have varying protect chances on various damage types"
  - tweak: " + Changeling Shield:	melee = 60, bullet = 50, laser = 40, energy = 30"
  - tweak: " + Tray Shield:			melee = 60, bullet = 50, laser = 40, energy = 30 (Now trayshields break based on the amount of taken damage overall, making them less RNG and more reliable)"
  - tweak: " + Bo Staff:			melee = 50, bullet = 50, laser = 50, energy = 50"
  - tweak: " + Riot Shield:			melee = 70, bullet = 60, laser = 40, energy = 30 (Added slowdown when deployed, can be deployed similar to telescopic/energy shield)"
  - tweak: " + Energy Shield:		melee = 60, bullet = 70, laser = 60, energy = 40 (still 100% reflect chance on energy projectiles tho)"
  - tweak: " + Telescopic Shield:	melee = 50, bullet = 30, laser = 20, energy = 20"
  - tweak: " + Roman Shield:		melee = 60, bullet = 50, laser = 50, energy = 50"
