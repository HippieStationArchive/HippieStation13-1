changes: 
  - rscadd: "Context-based grabs/Grab-Fu has been added from Atlas! Grabbing system got a major overhaul. You can now have meatshields with neck grab, cover someone's eyes or mouth and more! Check the pull request on github for more info."
  - rscadd: "Damp rag no longer useless! Smothering added. Grab intent + aim at mouth/head + attack with rag to auto-grab someone and smother them. Also works to just grab someone with damp rag in other hand."
