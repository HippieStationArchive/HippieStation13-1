  - rscadd: "The Wizard now has access to the Book of Darkness, containing three very powerful spells centered around the undead and an artifact that grows stronger the more souls it consumes. Costs 5 and can be found in the Assistance tab. The contents of this book are also sold seperately."
  - rscadd: "Soulflare lets you deal hefty damage to anyone on your screen, briefly stun them and if it hits an enemy in critical condition, the cooldown is permanently lowered and they are instantly killed."
  - rscadd: "Corpse Explosion let's you blow up a corpse in a 9x9 area centered on the target. Who needs Maxcaps when you can just recycle scientsits?"
  - rscadd: "Soulsplit lets you walk trough everything at incredibly high speeds for 3.5 seconds, but it can only be cast if you are at full health!"
  - rscadd: "The Staff of Revenant is a weak staff that lets you drain the souls of the dead from their corpses, empowering the staff to incredible heights."
