changes: 
  - rscadd: "New H.E.V suit and helmet added. They both have moderate protection from lasers, bullets, and melee attacks, with high protection from bombs, radiation, and biological threats. These are not the only qualities of the suit or helmet however. Credits to Nienhaus for all sprites."
  - rscadd: "The H.E.V suit can be made from the R&D protolathe, but it requires high research and quite a few materials, most of them needed from mining."
