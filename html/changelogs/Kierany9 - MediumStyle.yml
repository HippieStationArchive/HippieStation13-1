  - experiment: "Weapons deal full brute damage on prone targets and do not deal any stamina damage."
  - tweak: "Fists now deal less stamina damage and more brute damage."
  - rscadd: "You can now stomp people if you are wearing boots and they are prone. Stomping deals full brute damage instead of a mix of brute and stamina."

  - tweak: "Syndciate magboots have reduced slowdown when active."
