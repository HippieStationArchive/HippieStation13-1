# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.

  - tweak: "Knockdowns when aiming for the body have had their duration drastically reduced but deal decent stamina damage."
  - tweak: "Knockdown and knockout chance is capped at 35% and 25% respectively, and the bonus chance when aiming for the chest has been removed."
