changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed C4 signaller assemblies not activating when C4's are planted"
  - bugfix: "Fixed flashes being unattachable to assemblies due to screwdriver unscrewing battery panel (you have to do that with wirecutters now)"
  - bugfix: "Fixed health scanners straight up not working"
  - bugfix: "Fixed infrared sensors having extremely odd behaviour"
  - bugfix: "Fixed all assembly time mechanisms taking twice as long than they should (if you set your timer to, like, 6 seconds, it'll actually tick down like you expect it to instead of it taking 12 seconds)"
  - bugfix: "Fixed C4 signaller assemblies not activating when C4's are planted"
  - tweak: "Moved assemblies to their own category on the autolathe"
  - tweak: "Tweaked button animations to use flick() proc (they will no longer have odd timing)"
  - tweak: "Opening doors via the respective wire no longer requires ID wires to be cut (this makes door-opening assemblies not completely useless if you don't want assistants barging into places)"
  - rscadd: "Added keypads! You can craft a keypad frame using metal. To construct it, you need to activate the assembly in-hand to set the password. If you want to reset the password you have to use the multitool on the assembly. Then, attach it to a wall, wire it and insert assemblies into it to be used when the password input is correct and when it's wrong. Screw the cover shut and viola!"
