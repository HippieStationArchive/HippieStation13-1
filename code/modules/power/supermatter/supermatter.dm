	How to tweak the SM

	POWER_FACTOR		directly controls how much power the SM puts out at a given level of excitation (power var). Making this lower means you have to work the SM harder to get the same amount of power.
	CRITICAL_TEMPERATURE	The temperature at which the SM starts taking damage.

	CHARGING_FACTOR		Controls how much emitter shots excite the SM.
	DAMAGE_RATE_LIMIT	Controls the maximum rate at which the SM will take damage due to high temperatures.
*/

//Controls how much power is produced by each collector in range - this is the main parameter for tweaking SM balance, as it basically controls how the power variable relates to the rest of the game.
#define POWER_FACTOR 0.5
#define DECAY_FACTOR 700			//Affects how fast the supermatter power decays
#define CRITICAL_TEMPERATURE 800	//K
#define CHARGING_FACTOR 0.05
#define DAMAGE_RATE_LIMIT 3			//damage rate cap at power = 300, scales linearly with power
