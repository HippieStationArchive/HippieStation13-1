/*
	This is /tg/'s 'newer' lighting system. It's basically a combination of Forum_Account's and ShadowDarke's
	respective lighting libraries heavily modified by Carnwennan for /tg/station with further edits by
	MrPerson. Credits, where due, to them.

	Originally, like all other lighting libraries on BYOND, we used areas to render different hard-coded light levels.
	The idea was that this was cheaper than using objects. Well as it turns out, the cost of the system is primarily from the
	massive loops the system has to run, not from the areas or objects actually doing any work. Thus the newer system uses objects
	so we can have more lighting states and smooth transitions between them.

	This is a queueing system. Everytime we call a change to opacity or luminosity throwgh SetOpacity() or SetLuminosity(),
	we are simply updating variables and scheduling certain lights/turfs for an update. Actual updates are handled
	periodically by the SSlighting subsystem. Specifically, it runs check() on every light datum that ran changed().
	Then it runs redraw_lighting() on every turf that ran update_lumcount().

	Unlike our older system, there are hardcoded maximum luminosities (different for certain atoms).
	This is to cap the cost of creating lighting effects.
	(without this, an atom with luminosity of 20 would have to update 41^2 turfs!) :s

	Each light remembers the effect it casts on each turf. It reduces cost of removing lighting effects by a lot!

	Known Issues/TODO:
		Shuttles still do not have support for dynamic lighting (I hope to fix this at some point) -probably trivial now
		No directional lighting support. (prototype looked ugly)
		Allow lights to be weaker than 'cap' radius
		Colored lights
